# Hi, I'm Akash 👋

**AWS-Certified Data & GenAI Engineer** building production AI systems with real business impact.

## 🧠 My Learning Philosophy

I'm a **hands-on learner** who believes the best way to understand technology is to build with it. Whenever I discover a new tool, framework, or concept, I don't just read the docs—I build a POC or small project to truly understand its capabilities and limitations. 

**This GitHub is my learning lab** 🔬—a collection of experiments, POCs, and production-inspired projects that showcase what I've learned and how I apply new technologies to solve real problems.

## 🚀 What I'm Currently Building

- **Production Marketing Analytics AI platform** (AWS Bedrock + RAG + QuickSight)  
  *Conversational analytics enabling natural language queries over multi-channel campaign data*

- **Agentic AI systems** using LangChain and AWS Bedrock  
  *Multi-step reasoning agents with tool integration and autonomous decision-making*

- **Real-time data pipelines** processing 500K+ records/day  
  *Event-driven ETL architecture with automated quality validation*

## 💼 Current Role
